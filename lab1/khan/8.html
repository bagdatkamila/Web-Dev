        <p class = "att">Osaka (大阪, Ōsaka) is Japan's second largest metropolitan area after Tokyo. <br>
            It has been the economic powerhouse of the Kansai Region for many centuries.<br>
             Osaka was formerly known as Naniwa. <br>
             Before the Nara Period, when the capital used to be moved with the reign of each new emperor, Naniwa was once Japan's capital city, the first one ever known. </p>

        <img src = "c:\Users\admin\Downloads\kioto-16950550622955_w687h357.jpg" alt = "Kyoto" width = "500">

            It is one of the country's ten largest cities with 1.5 million inhabitants and a modern face. <br>

            Over the centuries, Kyoto was destroyed by many wars and fires, but due to its exceptional historic value, the city was dropped from the list of target cities for the atomic bomb and escaped destruction during World War II.</p>
